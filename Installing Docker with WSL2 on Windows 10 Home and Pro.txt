Installing Docker with WSL2 on Windows 10 Home and Pro
WSL2

Windows 10 Pro and some Windows 10 Home users will be able to install Docker Desktop if their computer supports the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

Please see this guide first which includes all of the steps to install and enable WSL2:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

Once you have successfully installed and enabled WSL2 and then installed the Linux OS of your choice, continue to the Docker Desktop installation docs here:

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/

With Docker Desktop installed using WSL2 as a backend, you will now be able to follow along with the course. You will access the applications at localhost just like we do in the video lectures.

Important - A significant difference when using WSL2 is that you will need to create and run your project files from within the Linux filesystem, not the Windows filesystem. This will be very important in later lectures when we cover volumes.

You can access your Linux system by running wsl in the Windows Search Bar. Going forward, all Docker commands should be run within WSL2 and not on the Windows file system.
